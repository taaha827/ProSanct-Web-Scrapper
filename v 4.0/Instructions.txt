*Read this before Doing anything*

First of all download this rar file and extract it in your wamp servers www folder
 after that from the root folder download phantom js.exe and after that download the tesseract-win64.rar file extract it in C:\Program Files\tesseract
 and then place eng.traineddata file in tesseract\tessdata
 after doing to that create an environment variable in your Computer settings named TESSDATA_PREFIX and place the path to eng.trainneddata like C:\Program Files\tesseract\tessdata
 afte all that install the necessary libraries which are mentioned in the readme file in the root directory . After that just open the scrapping_image.py and change the 
 appropiate paths everywhere. In the variable pytesseract.pytesseract.tesseract_cmd place the file path to tesseract.exe which you extracted earlier.
 Then just update the specific paths accordingly.
 Then from the list you have create a folder and create website_name_scrapper.py and place the code below:
 import sys

from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

#give the appropiate path but you may not have to change this if you follow the instruction
sys.path.append('C:\\wamp64\\www\\ProSanct-Web-Scrapper-master')
import scrapping_image

if __name__ == "__main__":
     obj = scrapping_image.scraping("Website URL ", "Website name","Leave this empty","Leave this empty")
     #obj.getresponse()
     #obj.extractresponse()
     #obj.specificextraction("Specific tag you want to target for images","The attribute which you want to use to specify that ","Value of that")
     #obj.saving_image()
     obj.FilePathReader("name of the folder you have placed the scripts in")
     obj.checkaccuracy()
